# Mass-Mail-Sender
A tool for sending mails from your gmail account to receivers one by one with attachments using JavaMail API. 

Found the source code from https://pepipost.com/tutorials/send-email-in-java-using-gmail-smtp/ and modified it a little so it would look more like OOP

You need a credentials.txt which will contain your gmail address and password,
         an attachments.txt which will contain the paths of the attachments you would like to add,
         a mails.txt to contain the receivers' addresses,
         and a mailbody.txt to contain your message
         all in classpath.
         
And you need to enable less secure apps to access your gmail account.
